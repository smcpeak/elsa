<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>
This tutorial is intended to help get a new Elsa user learn about
the Elsa and develop a basic familiarity with the core components.
After doing this tutorial, you will know how to do the following
tasks:
<ul>
<li>Build Elsa
<li>Parse and pretty-print a C++ file
<li>Write a simple tree traversal analysis with ASTVisitor.
<li>Write a simple language extension, including extensions to
    the lexer, parser, AST, type checker, and pretty printer.
</ul>

<p>
If you run into difficulties you cannot resolve, you can email me at
<pre>
  smcpeak cs berkeley edu
         @  .        .
</pre>
though I might not respond right away.

<p>
At the end of this tutorial I will give pointers for more exploration.



<h1>2. Building Elsa</h1>

<p>
If you have not already, download and
<span style="border-bottom: thin dashed blue"
      title="To unpack, say 'tar xvfz elsa-XXXX.XX.XX.tar.gz'.">unpack</span>
the Elsa distribution tarball, available from the
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smcpeak/elkhound/">Elkhound page</a>.
Inside the Elsa distribution you will find a directory structure like this:
<pre>
  elsa-XXXX.XX.XX
    |
    +- smbase               utility library
    |
    +- ast                  AST generator
    |
    +- elkhound             parser generator
    |
    +- elsa                 C++ parser/frontend/etc.
       |
       +- in                  C/C++ input files for regression testing
       |
       +- include             Elsa's compiler-specific headers
</pre>

<h2>2.1 Configure</h2>

<p>
At the top <code>elsa-XXXX.XX.XX</code> directory, just run <code>configure</code>:
<pre>
  elsa-XXXX.XX.XX$ ./configure
</pre>
The above command just runs <code>configure</code> scripts in each of the four
subdirectories.  If you want to pass specific options to a configure script
inside a specific directory, just go into the directory and run its
particular script.

<p>
In particular, if you want to be able to use the
<a href="../../smbase/trace.html">tracing flags</a>, which I recommend,
then pass the <code>-debug</code> option to <code>elsa/configure</code>:
<pre>
  elsa-XXXX.XX.XX$ cd elsa
  elsa$ ./configure -debug
  elsa$ cd ..
</pre>

<h2>2.2 Make</h2>

<p>
At the top, run <code>make</code>:
<pre>
  elsa-XXXX.XX.XX$ make
</pre>
This just runs <code>make</code> in each of the four directories.

<p>
Hopefully, everything will build without problems.  If not, it's
possible you will have to change one or more of the source files
to get them to compile.  In that case, please send me the changes
that you found necessary.

<h2>2.3 Make check</h2>

<p>
At the top, run <code>make check</code>:
<pre>
  elsa-XXXX.XX.XX$ make check
</pre>
Again, this just runs <code>make check</code> in each of the four directories.
While this step is in principle optional, if something fails during the
<code>make check</code> then it's likely there is a serious problem.

<h1>3. Run ccparse</h1>

<p>
Among the executables produced by <code>make</code> is <code>elsa/ccparse</code>,
a program that runs the C++ parser and optionally does a number of
post-processing activities.  While developing Elsa, <code>ccparse</code>
is the program that I run most often.

<h2>3.1 Parsing alone</h2>

<p>
<code>ccparse</code> takes the name of file to parse on the command line:
<pre>
  elsa-XXXX.XX.XX$ cd elsa
  elsa$ ./ccparse in/t0001.cc
  %%% progress: 0ms: done parsing (1 ms, 0_234564 cycles)
  ambiguous nodes: 0
  %%% progress: 5ms: done type checking (4 ms)
  typechecking results:
    errors:   0
    warnings: 0
  %%% progress: 6ms: done elaborating (0 ms)
</pre>
The output includes "<code>%%% progress</code>" lines that report on stages
of processing and timing information, the number of ambiguous nodes in
the AST, and the number of warnings and errors emitted by the type
checker.  Since everything worked, the output isn't all that interesting.

<h2>3.2 Pretty printing</h2>

<p>
We can ask <code>ccparse</code> to print out the source code it has just
parsed in, by using the <code>--pretty-print</code> command-line argument:
<pre>
  elsa$ ./ccparse --pretty-print in/t0001.cc
  %%% progress: 0ms: done parsing (0 ms, 0_235561 cycles)
  ambiguous nodes: 0
  %%% progress: 5ms: done type checking (3 ms)
  typechecking results:
    errors:   0
    warnings: 0
  %%% progress: 7ms: done elaborating (0 ms)
  ---- START ----
  // -*-c++-*-
  int x;
  ---- STOP ----
</pre>
Buried in amongst all that noise is the pretty-printed input file:
<pre>
  // -*-c++-*-
  int x;
</pre>

<p>
Obviously, <code>in/t0001.cc</code> is a fairly trivial input file.
You're free to experiment with other files in the <code>in/</code>
directory, or even with your own input files.  <b>Note:</b> You
must preprocess with the input files with <code>cpp</code> first!
Elsa does not include a preprocessor.

<h2>3.3 Printing the Abstract Syntax Tree</h2>

<h3>3.3.1 <code>in/t0001.cc</code></h3>

<p>
<code>ccparse</code> can print the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) produced
by the parser, by passing <code>-tr printAST</code>:
<pre>
  elsa$ ./ccparse -tr printAST in/t0001.cc
  %%% progress: 0ms: done parsing (1 ms, 0_235436 cycles)
  tree = TranslationUnit:
    topForms:
      topForms[0] = TF_decl:
        loc = in/t0001.cc:3:1
        decl = Declaration:
          dflags =
          spec = TS_simple:
            cv =
            loc = in/t0001.cc:3:1
            id = int
          decllist:
            decllist[0] = Declarator:
              context = DC_UNKNOWN
              decl = D_name:
                loc = in/t0001.cc:3:5
                name = PQ_name:
                  loc = in/t0001.cc:3:5
                  name = x
              init is null
              ctorStatement is null
              dtorStatement is null
  ambiguous nodes: 0
  %%% progress: 9ms: done type checking (3 ms)
  typechecking results:
    errors:   0
    warnings: 0
  %%% progress: 11ms: done elaborating (0 ms)
</pre>
From this printout we can see that the entire input is a
<code>TranslationUnit</code>, whose first <code>topForm</code> is a <code>Declaration</code>.
The declaration has a type specifier, <code>TS_simple</code>, denoting <code>int</code>.
It also has a single <code>Declarator</code>, with a <code>D_name</code> containing
<code>x</code>.

<p>
Besides the structural information, the printout includes source locations,
such as "<code>in/t0001.cc:3:1</code>".  This means line 3, column 1 of the
file <code>in/t0001.cc</code>.

<h3>3.3.1 <code>in/t0008.cc</code> (ambiguous)</h3>

<p>
The AST above is <em>unambiguous</em>; the parser was able to completely
determine the syntactic interpretation of the input file, without any
help from the type checker.  This isn't always possible with C++, and
since the Elsa type checker runs only <em>after</em> the parser, the
parser sometimes produces an ambiguous AST.  A simple example is in
<code>in/t0008.cc</code>:
<pre>
  elsa$ ./ccparse -tr printAST in/t0008.cc
  %%% progress: 0ms: done parsing (3 ms, 3_369729 cycles)
  tree = TranslationUnit:
    topForms:
      topForms[0] = TF_func:
        loc = in/t0008.cc:4:1
        f = Function:
          receiver: NULL
          retVal: NULL
          dflags =
          retspec = TS_simple:
            cv =
            loc = in/t0008.cc:4:1
            id = int
          nameAndParams = Declarator:
            context = DC_UNKNOWN
            decl = D_func:
              loc = in/t0008.cc:4:5
              base = D_name:
                loc = in/t0008.cc:4:5
                name = PQ_name:
                  loc = in/t0008.cc:4:5
                  name = main
              params:

<h3>3.3.1 <code>in/t0008.cc</code> (unambiguous)</h3>

<p>
The ambiguity can be resolved (in favor of <code>E_binary</code>) by
considering that the name <code>x</code> refers to a variable, not a
type.  The type checker does just this, and produces an
unambiguous AST.  The <code>-tr printTypedAST</code> command line
option will print the AST as it exists after the type checker
runs:

<p>
If you look carefully at the output, you will see that in addition
to being unambiguous, the post-tcheck AST also has been annotated
with information about the types of expressions, and the variables
to which names refer.  This information is very useful to analyses
that come after the type checker.

<p>
If you want, take some time to experiment with <code>ccparse</code> and
the trees it can print.  Find some nasty C++ and see what Elsa
thinks of it!  Try to crash Elsa!  When you've had your fill of
segfaults (send me bug reports please?), you're ready to go on
to the next part of the tutorial.
