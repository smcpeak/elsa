Notes on design of the clang importer


The clang 'NamedDecl' corresponds approximately to an Elsa 'Variable',


Superclass  Discrim func    Example value        Subclass
----------  --------------  -------------        --------------
Stmt        getStmtClass()  BreakStmtClass       BreakStmt
                            BinaryOperatorClass  BinaryOperator // Expr isa Stmt
Decl        getKind()       Var                  VarDecl


When a variable refers to a clang AST node, if it is a function
parameter, then its name is 'clangXXX' where 'XXX' is the type of the
AST node.  If it is a local with a short scope, its name is 'cxxx' where
'xxx' is the initials of the type of the AST node.  If it is a local
with a longer scope, then it is named like a parameter.

For example:

  int foo(clang::VarDecl const *clangVarDecl);     // parameter
  clang::VarDecl const *cvd = ...;                 // short-lived local

Rationale: In both cases, I want the name to pretty clearly indicate it
comes from clang, hence the "clang" or "c" prefix.  Then, depending on
scope length, I lean toward either clarity or convenience.
